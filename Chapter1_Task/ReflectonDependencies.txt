    1.Dependency Inversion:

        --If I want to visit Switzerland, I will pack my luggage along with all clothes, visa, and passport. If you want to visit a new country, it is very difficult to plan. That's when you reach out to travel agencies so that you can easily visit. In this example, the country is a high-level dependency, and the travel agency is a low-level dependency to visit new places.
